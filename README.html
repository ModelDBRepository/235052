<p>The afterhyperpolarization (AHP) is canonically viewed as a major factor underlying the
refractory period, serving to limit neuronal firing rate. We recently reported (Wang et al, 
J. Neurophys. 116:456, 2016) that enhancing the amplitude of the fast AHP in 
a relatively slowly firing neuron (versus fast spiking neurons), augments neuronal excitability
in dentate gyrus granule neurons expressing gain-of-function BK channels. Here we present a novel, 
quantitative hypothesis for how varying the amplitude of the fast AHP (fAHP) can, paradoxically, 
influence a subsequent spike tens of milliseconds later.

Installation
<hr/>

<p>Compile all files in the mods folder to generate special executable. In unix/linux type a command like:<p/>
  nrnivmodl mods
  <p>If you need extra help in this above step for your platform, please consult this web page: <a href="https://senselab.med.yale.edu/ModelDB/NEURON_DwnldGuide.cshtml">https://senselab.med.yale.edu/ModelDB/NEURON_DwnldGuide.cshtml</a>

<hr/>
Run simulation
<hr/>

<p>nrngui Fig2.hoc
</p>
Takes just a few minutes to run and generates output files 1 through 4. You may need to exit Neuron to have the last output file have its contents flushed to disk.
<hr/>
Plot output
<hr/>

<p>python PlotFig2.py</p>

You should see graphs of voltage trajectories and this one similar to Fig 2C1 in the paper:<p/>
